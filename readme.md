Practice HTML syntax by converting a mockup of a blog article into a real website!

Project Self-Review
Take a moment to double check that your index.html file renders exactly like the mockup! You do not have to match the margins (spacing along the sides) of the mockup.
Make sure you've answered all the questions for the reflection. Feel free to use your native language!
Check your project against the Project Rubric. If you want additional feedback, post in the course forums or Slack.
Good luck! I know that you can do it ðŸš€
